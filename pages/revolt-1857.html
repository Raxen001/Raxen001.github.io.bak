<p>sepoy Mangal Pandey of the 34th Bengal Native Infantry (BNI) declared rebellion
against his commanders and fired the first shot at a British officer.</p>
<ul>
<li>He and an accomplice were court-martialed and hanged a few days later.</li>
<li>The regiment was disbanded.</li>
<li>Many of the sepoys felt that the punishment meted out to Pandey was unwarranted,
  further fuelling them with anger and resentment with the British establishment.</li>
<li>At Meerut, there was a large cantonment with more than 2000 Indian soldiers.</li>
</ul>
<h3>On 24th April</h3>
<ul>
<li>The commanding officer of the 3rd Bengal Light Cavalry ordered his
  troops to parade and fire the rifles as part of the drill. All the men, except
  <strong>5</strong>, refused to do so. <strong>85 sepoys were court-martialed and sentenced to 10 years
  imprisonment on 9th May</strong>.</li>
<li>All the accused soldiers were stripped off uniforms and shackled publicly before the whole unit.
  The very next day, the remaining soldiers openly mutinied and set free their 85 comrades from the prisons. 
  They also killed several European officers. </li>
<li>The revolt spread to the city of Meerut
  as well. The mutinying soldiers reached Delhi, the seat of the Mughal Emperor
  on <em>11th May</em>. </li>
<li>They captured the city and declared the Mughal Emperor Bahadur
  Shah Zafar as the Emperor of Hindustan. The rebellion spread to many places in
  Northern India including <strong>Kanpur, Lucknow, Jhansi, Gwalior and Bihar</strong>. Many
  Indian princes and rulers joined in the revolt. The most important names are
  the Rani of Jhansi, Tantya Tope, Nana Saheb, Kunwar Singh, etc. The larger
  princely states of Hyderabad, Travancore, Kashmir, Mysore and the smaller
  kingdoms of Rajputana also refrained from joining the revolt. Ordinary people,
  peasants, landlords, Hindus of all castes, Muslims, traders, all joined this
  rebellion. The British crushed the revolt ruthlessly, although it took them
  about 18 months to completely suppress it. The revolt saw a lot of unity among
  the Indians irrespective of their religious and caste</li>
