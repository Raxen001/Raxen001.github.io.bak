# A parting gift

## Preface

Hi, You are probably wondering why this is in a form of a blog and not a letter.
Cause i wanted try out something new. Don't know how it will end up.

### How to read this blog.

I have attached a song "Good Riddance by Green day."
The song has to be played while you are reading this. It will give ambiance.

## The beginning

Once upon a time, On a land on the outreach of Chennai, where like minded people
came to learn science and way of life. Where the their youth were nourished and
they were becoming young citizens. 
There the story of Ookangi clan started...

### January 2022

How I a introvert meet new people is through extroverts and discord is my buddy.
No need to even put your own face as dp no real name no thing, psudo-annonymous.
1st year studen server REC 2025 as know it just started. People were joining.
And people were finding new people. Cuase socializing in covid situation was hard.
Also batch wise class so Tuesday batch didn't know Monday batch. Anyway Noumaan
was a freaking extrovert to the limits like he likes to meet new people. I fucking hate it.
He was like let's go watch Anjali streaming Tomb Raider and we crashed the stream. It was fun.
Coming from my school with no one who shared similar interest as me to meeting people.
Who share the same world viewes and similar interest was very pleasing the say the least.
I befriended Anjali.
